Instructions for Smart Interactive App.

Congratulations! Now you've got your very own Smart Interactive App to make your life easier! That is basically our motto "Makes the users' life easier".
Now you need to know how to run SIA. You obviously downloaded the correct version for your operating system and also downloaded Python 3.6 which is compulsory!
First of all right click start.command/start.cmd and open it with your terminal. It should get started right away! It will greet you and tell you what Model of SIA
you are using. If this your first time using SIA it will ask: "Is this your first time using SIA? yes or no" Reply with yes and it will
ask you for a password you want to use, make sure it is easy to remember but to guess! Then type in an email you want to use. It will return you
to the password section and it will ask you for a password. Input the one you wanted to use before. Then it will ask how to address you. You can put anything ridiculous
like, "Sergeant Lime." What a ridiculous name. You're in! Go explore the many things you can do on SIA!
