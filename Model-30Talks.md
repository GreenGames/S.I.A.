Hello! Sergent Lime is here to talk? What is the correct term to use instead of talk. Anywhere Model 30 is right around the corner and 
I am here to tell you about new updates and other stuff.

# NEW STUFF
New stuff that will be put into Smart Interactive App(SIA) are:
Converting decimal to percentage, percentage to decimal, percentage to fraction, fraction to percentage, decimal to fraction, and fraction
to decimal math function.
A way to record SIA's workings
Add more security protocols
Revamping the code to make it more easier for developers to track everything
Credits!
and also Sergent Lime is the new Head of Development

Converting decimals, percentages, and fractions into eachother explained.
I, Sergent Lime, wish to add more math functions slowly with every model-add. For this model-add I implemented converting decimals, percen-
tages, and fractions into eachother.

Recording SIA's work explained
I see in the future there will be a mode called Developer Mode which pickle dumps everything into a pickle file.

More security protocols explained.
In Model-24 SIA was introduced to Security Protocols. They were called whenever a security breach was detected. I wish to add more protoc-
ols like one for when the user modify the code

Revamp the code explained.
I want to make it easier to read the code. I want to pack everything into one function but this will remove lots of original code but who cares?

Credits explained.
Really?

Sergent Lime.
Sergent Lime is the new Head of Development for SIA


# OTHER STUFF
COMPATIBILITY
Regarding Windows compatibility, Mr Green unfortunately glossed over the app launcher function.He didn't see Windows' emptiness of a programming and only now have I discovered the flaw during atesting of Model 30. Launching an exe file in Windows is much more harder to program than launching an app in Mac. Launching an exe for Windows via SIA will not be added anytime soon.
