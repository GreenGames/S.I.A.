# SIA
Programmed in Python 2.7 and Converted to 3.6
The Smart Interactive App is used to make the user's life much more easier. With its many functions it can be a calculator, email sender, browse the web, and much more! Plus it has a builtin helper called Shelly(SIAHelp). It also has an excellent security system that calls protocols as soon as it detects a security breach.

# Compatibility
Unfortunately, SIA can only work with Mac and Windows. GreenGames will try their hardest to find a way to make it more compatible with different platforms. This may take a while if you consider having to recode everything to make fit with the platform
